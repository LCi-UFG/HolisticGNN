# Holistic GNNs: Graph Neural Networks Enhanced with Multi-Connectivity Architecture
A novel Graph Neural Network architecture that combines Jumping Knowledge Networks, Virtual Nodes, and Skip Connections for enhanced molecular property prediction and graph-level tasks.

## 🔬 Overview
HolisticGNNs introduces a multi-connectivity approach to Graph Neural Networks by integrating key architectural components:

- Jumping Knowledge Networks: Multi-scale feature aggregation across different network depths
- Virtual Nodes: Global information exchange through auxiliary nodes connected to all graph nodes
- Skip Connections: Residual pathways for improved gradient flow and feature preservation

This combination enables better long-range dependency modeling and enhanced representation learning for complex graph-structured data.

### 🚀 Architectures Included:
- MPNN
- GIN
- GAT
- AttentiveFP
- EEGNN
- TMPNN
